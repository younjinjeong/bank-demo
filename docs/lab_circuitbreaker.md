# Creating the Circuit Breaker Dashboard.

Cloud-native architectures are typically composed of multiple layers of distributed services. End-user requests may comprise multiple calls to these services, and if a lower-level service fails, the failure can cascade up to the end user and spread to other dependent services. Heavy traffic to a failing service can also make it difficult to repair. Using Circuit Breaker Dashboard, you can monitor a service for failure, prevent failures from cascading, and supply dependent services until the failing service is operable again.

The code to create a circuit breaker involved providing a fallback method. For example:

```java
  @HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod = "getCompaniesFallback")
	public List<CompanyInfo> getCompanies(String name) {
		logger.debug("Fetching companies with name or symbol matching: " + name);
		CompanyInfo[] infos = restTemplate.getForObject("http://quotes/company/{name}", CompanyInfo[].class, name);
		return Arrays.asList(infos);
	}

	private List<CompanyInfo> getCompaniesFallback(String name) {
		List<CompanyInfo> infos = new ArrayList<>();
		return infos;
	}
```
It is useful to know when the circuits are open as it may suggest a problem with the dependent services. [Spring Cloud Services for Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-spring-cloud-services) provides a centralised dashboard to collect all the statistics from circuit breakers and visualize them in one place.

Underneath the covers, this circuit breaker pattern is implemented using the [Spring Cloud Netflix - Hystrix](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/).

In order to make use of the dashboard, we need to create an instance of the service to bind it to our applications.
### Exercise

1. Log in to the Apps Manager through your browser. The URL will be: `https://console.<your_cloud_foundry_url>/`

Go the *Marketplace* and choose a *Circuit Breaker for Pivotal Cloud Foundry standard*.

When prompted for the name of the service, insert **"circuit-breaker-dashboard"** and bind it to the space you are using to deploy your applications.

> You can pick any name of the service, however, the service is already specified in the manifest files, so it is easier to re-use that name. If you do modify the name, ensure you modify it in the manifest files as well.

# Summary

The circuit breaker dashboard can be accessed on the link provided in the console UI. Find the circuit breaker service you created and click on **Manage**.

You can now move on to [creating the configuration service](lab_configserver.md)
